# GraphAnalysis
Package for graph analysis in language Julia

The aim of this thesis is to create a module, which will expand the language JULIA on new functionality to analyze and process graphs. The motive for the 
creation of this module is that the language JULIA so far does not have the functionality that we have been implemented. The beginning of the work focuses on 
the analysis of the language JULIA and on the description of its design. Subsequently, there are analyzed available tools for creating, analyzing and processing 
graphs in the JULIA language. In the next chapters are also analyzed the resources provided by other dynamic languages such as Python and Matlab. In the next 
sections the work describes the design and methods of implementation for each analytical algorithm that we chose for implementation, as well as various 
complementary methods whose need of implementation has arisen during the creation of this bachelor thesis. In the final stage of work we managed to expand the 
functionality regarding analysis of graphs to decomposition of graph topology to k-cores and determination of basic types of centralities in JULIA language. 
Aside from this fundamental aim we have created the new complementary methods for processing of the graphs.
